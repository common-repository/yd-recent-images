== Description ==

= Recent images in a Widget =

Adds a very simple widget to show the recently added images of your blog as a list or galery of thumbnails.

You can choose to display any image of the library or only image that are actual post attachments.

Actual post attachments will have a link to the original post.

You can choose to display different images / galeries depending on pages based on original post tag and a custom field (meta).

You can then customize it with CSS if you like. It is possible to create galeries, featured posts, or visual recent posts lists.

Uses WordPress 2.8+ automatic thumbnail feature.
